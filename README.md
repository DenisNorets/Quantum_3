# How the task 3 is completed
1. All required modules have to be installed
2. Read the train csv file and separate it to variables X_train(52 columns - features) and y_train (1 column - target value to predict)
3. Read the test csv file and save it to tariable X_test
4. Cearch the best model from given to minimize the target metric RMSE in order to get the most accurate predictions for the target variable result_data
5. Get a prediction for the target variable result_data on the selected model, save the result to a csv file and output the result as pd.series
6. Visualize results of prediction
